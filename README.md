A short list of **core** R guides and galleries.

Following these can lead you from zero experience to mastering the key skills of data analysis and presentation with R.

Learn to analyse data with R
----------------------------

1.  **Code Skills:** Learn RStudio and R code from zero knowledge to quite advanced using [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/).

2.  **Code Style:** Write clear code that is easier to Quality Assure by following [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). Or, instead of following rules, run the [RStudio Styler add-in](http://styler.r-lib.org) to style your code automatically.

3.  **Package Code:** consider converting data analysis that is regularly repeated into a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/). Start to learn how to do this by building a simple [R Package](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) first.

Learn to visualise data with R
------------------------------

1.  Follow this [guide to the right visualisation for the task](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/), particularly the chapter on [telling a story and making a point](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html).

2.  Learn now to build ggplot charts step-by-step with this [flipbook guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1). And [this version](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html#1) starts with simple data preparation before building the charts step-by-step.

3.  Many "Addins" have been written for RStudio. When you run Addins the from the RStudio "Addins" menu they often create easy Point-and-Click interfaces that generate good working code. Here is a [long list of RStudio Add-ins](https://github.com/daattali/addinslist) maintained by the excellent Dean Attali (he is also an R Shiny instructor on DataCamp). The [esquisse](https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse) Addin is an excellent Point-and-Click interface for building and generating the code for simple ggplot charts. Even advanced R users can find ggplot code fiddly so should find this Addin useful.

4.  [Gallery of interactive R visualisations](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/). From this gallery, I strongly recommend trying the [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) package for time series charts, use Plotly for a huge variety of easy to code interactive charts, and [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com) is easy to code graphs that also include animation.

5.  This [gallery of ggplot extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) lets you create a greater variety of charts based on ggplots.
