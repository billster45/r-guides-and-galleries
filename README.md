A short list of **core** R guides and galleries.

Following these can lead you from zero experience to mastering the key skills of data analysis and presentation with R.

Learn to analyse data with R
----------------------------

1.  **Code Skills:** Learn RStudio and R code from zero knowledge to quite advanced using [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/).

2.  **Seek help often - become independent:** Independenlty finding out how to do something in R using Google and other resources is a really important skill too that you will always need. This [getting help in R](https://blog.rsquaredacademy.com/getting-help-in-r-updated/) blog summarises the main places to find help with R. Don't hesitate to look for help online or from other people. The more you do it the better you will get at judging which web sites and people help you quickly with good solutions.

3.  **Code Style:** Write clear code that is easier to Quality Assure by following [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). Or, instead of following rules, run the [RStudio Styler add-in](http://styler.r-lib.org) to style your code automatically.

4.  **Package Code:** consider converting data analysis that is regularly repeated into a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/). Start to learn how to do this by building a simple [R Package](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) first.

Learn to visualise data with R
------------------------------

1.  **Pick the right Viz:** Follow this [guide to the right visualisation for the task](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/), particularly the chapter on [telling a story and making a point](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html).

2.  **ggplot step-by-step:** Learn now to build ggplot charts step-by-step with this [flipbook guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1). And [this version](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html#1) starts with simple data preparation before building the charts step-by-step.

3.  **Use RStudio Addins:** Many "Addins" have been written for RStudio. When you run Addins the from the RStudio "Addins" menu they often create easy Point-and-Click interfaces that generate good working code. Here is a [long list of RStudio Add-ins](https://github.com/daattali/addinslist) maintained by the excellent Dean Attali (he is also an R Shiny instructor on DataCamp). The [esquisse](https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse) Addin is an excellent Point-and-Click interface for building and generating the code for simple ggplot charts. Even advanced R users can find ggplot code fiddly so should find this Addin useful.

4.  **Use interactive charts:** [Gallery of interactive R visualisations](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/). From this gallery, I strongly recommend trying the [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) package for time series charts, use [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) for a huge variety of easy to code interactive charts, and [echarts4r](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com) is easy to code graphs that also include animation.

5.  **Extend ggplot:** This [gallery of ggplot extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) lets you create a greater variety of charts based on ggplots.
