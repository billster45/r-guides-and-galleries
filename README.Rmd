These guides and galleries can lead you from zero experience to mastering the key skills of data analysis and presentation with R. I've put them together to help anyone totally new to R (like I was not long ago). While I know a lot more now, I still regularly come back to all theses guides and galleries to learn more. 

## Learn to analyse data with R

__Learn R Code Skills:__ Learn how to analyse data using RStudio from zero knowledge to quite advanced by following [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/). Another popular guide is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

__Totally new to code or R? Scared you will fail and feel stupid?:__ If you've never coded before, or you have struggled to improve your R skills, consider paying for gentle guided learning created by DataCamp. The DataCamp [data analyst skill track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-with-r) takes you through 16 courses in a logical order. They assume no knowledge or skill. 

__Don't train too much. Do real analysis early:__ It can be tempting to complete many courses before you feel ready to try your own analysis. Instead, try writing your own simple analysis in R code as soon as you can, even if you don't feel ready. Replacing an Excel task you know well with R code is often a good first project. Ideally, find a mentor to help you code your first projects. It's a quicker way to learn. Doing real things early is David Robinson's philosophy. He explains it well in the section titled [Get students doing powerful things early](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).

__Seek help often to become an independent problem solver:__ Don't hesitate to ask for help or to Google your problem or question. Getting better at solving your own problems in R using Google and other resources is an important skill to learn too, even when you have become an expert R programmer. This [getting help in R](https://blog.rsquaredacademy.com/getting-help-in-r-updated/) blog summarises the best places to find help online. The more you look for help, the better you become at judging which web sites and people can help you the most.

__Code Style:__ Write clear code that is easier to Quality Assure by following [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can also style your code automatically by running the [RStudio Styler add-in](http://styler.r-lib.org).

__Package Code:__ If your data analysis is regularly repeated or re-used, consider converting  it into a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/). Start to learn how to build a RAP by building the most simple [R Package](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) possible first. However, packages are a more advanced topic. You won't need to build them if you are just starting out.

__Use GitHub to save your code:__  Start saving your code on GitHub, even when you are only staring out to learn R. This called versioning your code. GitHub can be hard to learn if you start using it via the text commands you type into the command prompt. A better way to learn GitHub with RStudio is through the easy menus and buttons in RStudio, as described in this good  [Using git from Studio tutorial](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/version-control/4-getting-started-with-git-in-RStudio.html). However, GitHub can also be fiddly to install and get working with RStudio too. This is why Jenny Bryan has written [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) to help her students troubleshoot all the many problems. Because of the many challenges with GitHub, if you are just starting to learn it, try to seek out a good user who will help you get going in person.

## Learn to visualise data with R

__Explore your data first:__ There are several R tools let you explore your data interactively faster and easier than coding alone. For example:  

[esquisse](https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse) is an RStudio "Addin" that launches this Point-and-Click interface that lets you build simple ggplot plots, as well as automatically generating the code for each plot you create. Even advanced R users can find ggplot code tricky so esquisse can be useful for everyone. Here is a long list of many more [RStudio Add-ins](https://github.com/daattali/addinslist). 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreamRs/esquisse/master/man/figures/esquisse.gif){width=60%}

[rpivotTable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpivotTable/vignettes/rpivotTableIntroduction.html) is the R version of Excel's Pivot Tables and Charts. It's great for quickly exploring your data with heat maps, bar charts, line charts etc. in an R Markdown html output document.

__Make data exploration easy for yourself:__ Claus Wilke makes a good case in his chapter [Data exploration versus data presentation]
(https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/choosing-visualization-software.html#data-exploration-versus-data-presentation) for using any tool that makes data exploration quick and easy for you. Even using paper! You might find many different tools you know well could help you explore quickly. As you get better in R you will gradually use it more to explore your data.

__Pick the right visualistion to tell your data story:__ Browse the [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) guide by Claus Wilke to find the right visualisation for the point you are trying to make. The charts in Wilke's book are written in R code that you can find in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz). However, he didn't write his book to teach R code skills. It is tool and language neutral. For a good guide on how to create visualistions like Wilke's with R code start with the [graphs chapter](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) in the [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com). 

__Learn to build ggplots easily step-by-step:__ If you are just starting to use ggplot, learn intuitively how to build up the code you need one line at a time with this [flipbook guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1). While [this flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html#1) also includes some simple data preparation examples before building the charts step-by-step.

__Make your plots interactive:__ [Gallery of interactive R visualisations](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/). From this gallery, I strongly recommend trying the [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) package for time series charts and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) for a huge variety of easy to code interactive charts. When partnered with ggplot, just these three packages are a powerful data visualisation toolkit.

__See if a ggplot extension helps your story:__ This [gallery of ggplot extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) lets you create a greater variety of different plots that may better support your narrative. The most popular extension in this gallery is gganimate I describe next.

__Consider animating your plots:__ If movement of data points in your plot will help better explain the story you are telling, animate it with [gganimate](https://github.com/billster45/gganimate-experiments/blob/master/README.md). Learn how to [animate ggplots intuitively](https://github.com/billster45/gganimate-experiments/blob/master/README.md) using my guide inspired by a good Twitter post.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(transformr) # devtools::install_github("thomasp85/transformr")
library(magick)
library(gifski)
library(png)
library(gapminder)
library(cowplot)

p <- 
  ggplot2::ggplot(data = gapminder::gapminder) + 
  ggplot2::aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_log10() +
  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d() +
  ggplot2::scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy") +
  gganimate::transition_time(time = year) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}",
                subtitle = "The movement of these data points tells a meaningful story") +
  gganimate::shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.1, alpha = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
print(p)
gganimate::anim_save(filename = "./images/gapminder.gif")
```

## Putting it all together

__Be creative, but follow these rules!__ It is surprisingly easy to build bad or ugly visualisations but not realise on your own how it could be better. Continually criticise your own plots. Ask others to challenge your work. Use the rules in [The Office for National Satistics Data Visualisation guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/) to check your visualisation does not break them. Find the type of visualisation you have made in the contents of Clause Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) book. See if his advice can improve your plot. This Economist post called [Mistakes, we've drawn a few](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368) is a good example of effective self-criticism.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
p1 <- 
  ggplot2::ggplot(data = datasets::airquality) +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Day, y = Temp,
               colour= as.factor(Month)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(size = 1) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "This plot is bad & Ugly",
                subtitle = "Air quality each day by month") 

p2 <- 
  ggplot2::ggplot(data = datasets::airquality) +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Day, y = Temp) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(size = 1) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(color = 'steelblue', size = 1) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~Month, ncol = 2) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "This plot is better, but it could still be imporved. How?",
                subtitle = "Air quality each day by month") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
  
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html
plot2by2 <- cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2,
                      labels=c("A", "B"), 
                      ncol = 2)

cowplot::save_plot("./images/plot2by2.png", plot2by2,
          ncol = 2,
          base_aspect_ratio = 1.3
          )
```

__Present your final story:__ Tell an engaging story in your final write up. This chapter on [telling a story and making a point](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html) describes how you can tell stories with visuals that will engage your audience. Also, on the Data Science competition website called Kaggle, browse the [Kaggle "kernels"](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&language=R) in R with lots of votes. There are lots of are good examples of this kind of story telling you can learn from.

__Watch a master story teller in R at work:__ Even when you only have basic R code skills you will still benefit from watching how an R expert rapidly explores and visualises data to tell a story. David Robinson records live R coding videos in one hour on data he has never seen before. Here is a good example that explores [wind turbine locations](https://youtu.be/O1oDIQV6VKU) in the USA. It is one of the many [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data sets he has coded live with you can search for on YouTube.

__Telling good stories is hard:__ But often, you have spent so long with your data you will suffer from the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sense_of_Style#The_curse_of_knowledge). You can no longer remember what it's like to __not__ know what you now know. Assume as little knowledge as possible in your final document to defeat this curse.

__Widen your auidence. Democratise:__ But defeating the curse of knowledge is hard. Assuming prior knowledge can lead to you writing text, code and visualisations in ways that lose far more of your audience than you realise. Or even worse, you accidentally mislead them. A clear plain English style is not the same as dumbing down or over simplifying. You can still present technical topics. For example, here I have tried to explain [key Natural Language Processing techniques](https://github.com/billster45/NLP-Intuition/blob/master/README.md) in R while assuming no prior technical knowledge. Try not to be a gatekeeper of your growing R knowledge and skills. Share, explain and work to democratise what you know. You can move on to more complex analysis in R with an even higher value (as proposed by Richard Susskind in [The Future of Professions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198713398/)).
