These guides and galleries can help you master the key skills of data analysis and presentation with R. I've put them together to help anyone totally new to R (like I was not long ago). While I know a lot more now, I still come back to all theses guides and galleries to learn more. 

## Learn to analyse data with R

:one: __Learn data analysis in R from scratch:__ Learn how to analyse data using RStudio from zero knowledge to quite advanced by following [Modern R with the tidyverse](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/modern_R/). Another popular guide is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

:two: __Totally new to code or R? Scared you will fail and feel stupid?:__ If you've never coded before, or you have struggled to improve your R skills, consider paying for gentle guided learning from DataCamp. Their [Data Analyst with R skill track](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-analyst-with-r) takes you through 16 courses in a logical order. They assume no prior knowledge or skills.

:three: __Don't train too much. Do real analysis early:__ It can be tempting to complete many courses before you feel ready to try your own analysis. Instead, try writing your own simple analysis in R code as soon as you can, even if you don't feel ready. A good first project is replacing an Excel data task you know well with R code. Ideally, find a mentor to help you code your first projects. It's a quicker way to learn. Doing real things early is David Robinson's philosophy he explains in the section titled [Get students doing powerful things early](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).

:four: __Become an independent problem solver:__ Don't hesitate to ask for help or to Google your problem or question. Getting better at solving your own problems using Google and other resources is an important skill to learn too, even when you have become an expert R programmer. This [Getting Help in R](https://blog.rsquaredacademy.com/getting-help-in-r-updated/) blog tells you about the best places to find help. The more you look for help, the better you become at judging which web sites and people help you the most.

:five: __Write code in this clean style:__ Write clear code by following [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). It will be easier for you and others to Quality Assure. You can also style your code automatically by running the [RStudio Styler add-in](http://styler.r-lib.org).

:six: __Repeating the same analysis regularly? Consider converting to an R package:__ If your data analysis is regularly repeated, consider converting  it into a [Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP)](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/). Start to learn how to build a RAP by building the most simple [R Package](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) possible first. However, packages are a more advanced topic. You won't need to build them if you are just starting out.

:seven: __Use GitHub to save your code:__  Start saving your code on GitHub even when if you first start to learning R. This is called versioning your code. However, GitHub can be hard to learn if you only use the text commands typed at the command prompt. An easier way to learn GitHub with RStudio is through the menus and buttons as explained in [Using git from RStudio tutorial](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/version-control/4-getting-started-with-git-in-RStudio.html). GitHub can also be fiddly to get working with RStudio. This is why Jenny Bryan has written [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) to help her students troubleshoot the many potential problems. Because of these challenges with GitHub, ideally find an experienced user of RStudio and GitHUb to coach you in person.

## Learn to visualise data with R

:eight: __Explore your data first:__ Some R tools let you explore data interactively with a [Point-and-Click  interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_and_click). This can be faster and easier than coding alone, particularly when you first start to learn R. For example:  

* [esquisse](https://github.com/dreamRs/esquisse) is an RStudio "Addin" that launches the Point-and-Click interface shown below. Use it to build simple ggplot plots. The tool also automatically generates the code you need for each plot that you create with it. Even advanced R users can find ggplot code tricky so esquisse can be useful for everyone. Here is a long list of many more [RStudio Add-ins](https://github.com/daattali/addinslist) to try.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dreamRs/esquisse/master/man/figures/esquisse.gif){width=60%}

* [rpivotTable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpivotTable/vignettes/rpivotTableIntroduction.html) is the R version of Excel's Pivot Tables and Charts. It's great for quickly exploring your data with heat maps, bar charts, line charts etc.. in an R Markdown html output document (R Markdown is described later).

:nine: __Make data exploration easy for yourself:__ In his chapter [Data exploration versus data presentation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/choosing-visualization-software.html#data-exploration-versus-data-presentation) Claus Wilke suggests using any tool that makes data exploration quick and easy for you. As your R skills improve you will gradually use R code more to explore your data.

:one::zero: __Pick the right visualistion to tell your data story:__ Scan the left hand contents panel of the [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) guide by Claus Wilke to find the right visualisation for the point you are trying to make. The charts in his book are written in R code that you can find in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz). However, he didn't write the book to teach R code skills. It is tool and language neutral. Instead, learn how to create ggplot visualistions in R code with the [graphs chapter](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) of the [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com). 

:one::two: __Learn to build ggplots easily step-by-step:__ If you are just starting to use ggplot, learn intuitively how to build up the code you need one line at a time with this [flipbook guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1). While [this flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/tidyverse_in_action/tidyverse_in_action.html#1) also includes some simple data preparation code before the plots are built line by line.

:one::three: __Make your plots interactive:__ From the [Gallery of interactive R visualisations](http://gallery.htmlwidgets.org/) I strongly recommend [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) for a huge variety of easy to code interactive charts. And for easy to code time series charts [dygraphs](http://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/) is visually exciting. When partnered with ggplot, these three packages alone are a very powerful data visualisation toolkit.

:one::four: __Does a ggplot extension improve your story?:__ With this [gallery of ggplot extensions](https://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/) create a greater variety of ggplots that can improve the story you tell in data. The most popular extension is gganimate described next.

:one::five: __Consider animating your plots:__ If movement of data points better explains the story you are telling, animate them with [gganimate](https://github.com/billster45/gganimate-experiments/blob/master/README.md). Learn how to [animate ggplots intuitively](https://github.com/billster45/gganimate-experiments/blob/master/README.md) using my guide inspired by a good Tweet.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)
library(transformr) # devtools::install_github("thomasp85/transformr")
library(magick)
library(gifski)
library(png)
library(gapminder)
library(cowplot)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
p <- 
  ggplot2::ggplot(data = gapminder::gapminder) + 
  ggplot2::aes(x = gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_log10() +
  ggplot2::scale_color_viridis_d() +
  ggplot2::scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "GDP per capita", y = "Life expectancy") +
  gganimate::transition_time(time = year) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "Year: {frame_time}",
                subtitle = "The movement of these data points tells a meaningful story") +
  gganimate::shadow_wake(wake_length = 0.1, alpha = FALSE) +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
print(p)
gganimate::anim_save(filename = "./images/gapminder.gif")
```

## Putting it all together

:one::six: __Be creative - but don't break these rules!__ It is surprisingly easy to build bad or ugly visualisations and not realise how it could be better. Continually criticise your own plots. Ask others to challenge your work. Use [The Office for National Satistics Data Visualisation guide](https://style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-visualisation/) to check your visualisation does not break any of their rules. Find the type of visualisation you have made in the contents of Clause Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualisation](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) book. See if his advice for your type of plot can improve it. This Economist post called [Mistakes, we've drawn a few](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368) is a good example of effective self-criticism of data visualisation.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
p1 <- 
  datasets::airquality %>%
  dplyr::mutate(month = as.factor(Month)) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Day, 
               y = Temp,
               colour= month) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(size = 1) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "This plot is Bad & Ugly",
                subtitle = "Air temperature each day by month") 

p2 <- 
  datasets::airquality %>%
  dplyr::mutate(month = as.factor(Month)) %>%
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::aes(x = Day, 
               y = Temp) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(size = 1) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(color = 'steelblue', size = 1) +
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(~month, ncol = 2) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "This is better, but how can it be improved again?",
                subtitle = "Air temperature each day by month") +
  ggplot2::theme_minimal()
  
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html
plot2by2 <- cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2,
                      labels=c("A", "B"), 
                      ncol = 2)

cowplot::save_plot("./images/plot2by2.png", plot2by2,
          ncol = 2,
          base_aspect_ratio = 1.3
          )
```

:one::seven: __Present your final story:__ Tell an engaging data story in your final document. Claus Wilke's chapter on [telling a story and making a point](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/telling-a-story.html) shows you how to tell stories with engaging visuals that won't confuse your audience. On the Data Science competition website called Kaggle, browse the [Kaggle "kernels"](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&language=R) in R with the most votes.There are many ideas here for powerful story telling in data. 

:one::eight: __Present your story with R Mardown:__ One of the most effective formats for story telling in data is [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html), particularly if you create interactive html documents. Here is a [Quick Tour](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html). Browse through the examples of others in [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/).

:one::nine: __Watch a master story teller use R:__ Even with only basic R skills you can learn a lot from watching an R expert rapidly explore and visualise data to tell a story. David Robinson records himself carrying out live data analysis in R using data he has never seen before. In this recording he explores [wind turbine locations](https://youtu.be/O1oDIQV6VKU) in the USA. It is one of the many [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) data sets he has coded live. Here is an Rstudio competition winning Shiny app that can show the most liked tweets for each data set: [tidytuesday.rocks](https://nsgrantham.shinyapps.io/tidytuesdayrocks/)

:two::zero: __Telling good stories is hard because of the curse of knowledge:__ Aim to tell your data story to someone who doesn't know what you know about the data. But, it is surprisingly hard to remember what it was like to __not__ know what you now know, particularly after spending so long exploring the data set. This amnesia about your prior limited knowledge is called the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sense_of_Style#The_curse_of_knowledge). To defeat this curse, assume as little knowledge as possible in your final document. The more prior knowledge you assume, the more likely it is your text, code and visualisations lose your audience. Or even worse, you accidentally mislead them. 

:two::one: __Explain clearly. Democratise:__ A clear plain style in your writing, code and visualisations aimed at the widest audience possible doesn't have to be dumbed down or over simplified. You can still present technical topics. For example, here I have tried to explain [key Natural Language Processing techniques](https://github.com/billster45/NLP-Intuition/blob/master/README.md) in R while assuming no prior knowledge. Try not to be a gatekeeper of your growing R knowledge and skills. Share, explain and democratise what you know. You can then move on to more complex analysis in R with an even higher value (as proposed by Richard Susskind in [The Future of Professions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0198713398/)).
